pmdm.el

*pmdm.el* - poor man's desktop-mode - is a simple alternative to desktop-mode
for storing and opening loaded files.

Run *pmdm/write-opened-files* manually or in a hook before quitting
emacs to save the files you want to restore later and *pmdm/load-files*
to open the stored files again.

Customizable variable *pmdm/file-name* contains the name of the file used
to store the files list.
